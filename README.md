# LGCNS-5G-RAN-Platform

LGCNS-5G-RAN-Platform is a GPU-accelerated 5G RAN platform framework
productized by LG CNS, based on the NVIDIA Aerial Framework.

This project provides a unified platform for building, integrating,
and operating GPU-accelerated 5G RAN components, including PHY and
upper-layer RAN stacks, in virtualized and cloud-native environments.

## Key Features

- GPU-accelerated RAN platform framework
- Based on NVIDIA Aerial Framework
- Modular integration of RAN PHY and RAN Stack components
- Containerized and cloud-native architecture
- Optimized for NVIDIA CUDA-enabled GPU platforms
- Product-grade build, deployment, and operational tooling
- Designed for PoC, lab, and commercial RAN environments

## Platform Scope

LGCNS-5G-RAN-Platform serves as the **integration and execution framework**
for LGCNS RAN components, rather than a protocol implementation itself.

The platform provides:

- Lifecycle management for RAN components
- Integration framework for GPU-accelerated PHY
- Interfaces for RAN Stack (MAC/RLC/PDCP/RRC)
- Runtime orchestration and configuration
- Deployment templates and automation

## Supported Use Cases

- GPU-based vRAN platform validation
- 5G RAN PoC and lab environments
- Private 5G deployments
- Integration testing of RAN components
- Research and performance evaluation


## Notice

This repository is derived from the following upstream open-source project:

- **NVIDIA Aerial Framework**  
  https://github.com/NVIDIA/aerial-framework

The upstream project provides a reference framework for building
GPU-accelerated 5G RAN solutions on NVIDIA platforms.

LG CNS has adapted and extended the upstream framework to support
product-oriented integration, deployment, and operational requirements.

### Modifications and Enhancements by LG CNS

- Platform integration for LGCNS RAN components
- Product-oriented directory and configuration structure
- Deployment automation and operational tooling
- Integration with LGCNS 5G Core and RAN solutions

### A real-time signal processing framework

The Aerial Framework has been designed from the ground up to meet the needs of 3GPP Radio Access Networks — signal processing workloads with microsecond latency requirements. It is a single platform that unites research, testbeds, and production deployments to solve development challenges for real-time applications.

<p>
  <b>Use cases:</b> Signal processing applications with strict latency requirements <br>
  <b>Audience:</b> RAN system engineers, signal processing specialists, AI researchers <br>
  <b>Built with:</b> DOCA, DPDK, TensorRT, Python, JAX, PyTorch, C++, CUDA, and more
</p>

## Features

- ⚡ **Python → Real-time** – Prototype in Python and lower to high-performance GPU code.
- 🍱 **Clean separation** – Decouple signal-processing algorithm development from runtime execution.
- 🧩 **Modular pipelines** – Compose end-to-end pipelines from compiled, executable modules.
- 🔭 **Observability built-in** – Hooks for profiling and monitoring throughout development.
- 🔁 **One codebase** – Reuse components for prototyping, simulation, testing, and deployment.
- 🚀 **Modern toolchain** – Python 3.12+, C++20, CUDA 12.9, CMake, JAX, PyTorch, uv, ruff.
- 💻 **Developer-friendly** – Prototype on local machines and scale to live, production deployments.
- 📚 **Guided tutorials** – Jupyter notebooks ready to run in a Docker container.
- 🤖 **Targets 5GAdv & 6G** – Ships with an example AI-native PUSCH Pipeline. More to come.


## How It Works

</p>

The Aerial Framework combines two components:
- **Developer tools**: Tools to convert Python/JAX/PyTorch and C++/CUDA into pipelines of GPU-native code
- **Runtime engine**: Coordinates the execution of GPU pipelines with network interfaces 

### Aerial Framework Developer Tools
- **JAX → TensorRT** – Export JAX programs to StableHLO and lower to TensorRT engines using MLIR-TensorRT
- **Multi-language** – Author algorithms in JAX, PyTorch, or C++/CUDA and deploy to common runtime engine
- **Modern Profiling** – Leverage NVIDIA Nsight Systems to optimize pipelines and individual kernels to μs-level
- **AI native** – Seamlessly integrate with AI Frameworks allowing end-to-end differentiability

### Aerial Framework Runtime
- **CUDA graphs** – GPU operations run as CUDA graphs with TensorRT integration for deterministic execution
- **Task scheduler** – Pinned, high-priority threads on isolated CPU cores enforce microsecond slot timing
- **Inline GPU networking** – DOCA GPUNetIO and GPUDirect RDMA enable zero-copy packet transfer NIC ↔ GPU
- **Production driver** – Orchestrates pipelines, memory pools & multi-cell coordination

Aerial Framework supports two different environments depending on your use case.

**Development** - Developers prototype and optimize their algorithms in Python and then compile to GPU native code using MLIR-TensorRT.
This is accessible to any developer with a recent GPU ([compute capability](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) ≥ 8).

**Runtime** - Deployments run compiled TensorRT engines with deterministic scheduling and high-performance networking. Testing requires a GPU, NIC, and real-time kernel to validate that pipelines meet latency constraints using Medium Access Control (MAC) and Radio Unit (RU) emulation.

This approach bridges:
- **Development Productivity** - Write in high-level languages with rich ecosystems
- **Runtime Performance** - Execute with the speed and determinism of optimized C++
- **Low Latency Requirements** - Meet strict timing and latency constraints
